# task_1

This project was just an attempt to write and animate some of the popular searching algorithms. The 
animations are created with the use of `curses` library. The algorithms are:

* *breadth-first search* aka BFS
* *depth-first search* aka DFS
* *random search*
* *Dijkstra algorithm*
* *greedy search algorithm*
* *A-star*

The last two algorithms use heuristics function.
