# BI-ZUM and BI-PYT Semestral work

This project is an implementation of the popular **Snake** game authored by **Nikita Mortuzaiev**
for **FIT CTU in Prague**. The game is available in two modes: **Classic Snake** (the user is playing
using the keyboard and WASD or ARROWS keys) or **Snake AI** (the implementation of the Snake Artificial
Intelligence using the Genetic algorithm).

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running

To run the application, execute this in the project directory:

`python3 main.py`
